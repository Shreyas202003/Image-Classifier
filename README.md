# Image Classifier using CNN

## Project Overview
This project implements an image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to categorize images into various classes such as forests, oceans, glaciers, and more.

## Key Features
- **Model**: Built using CNN for multi-class image classification.
- **Dataset**: Uses a labeled image dataset with different categories (e.g., buildings, streets, etc.).
- **Training**: The model is trained on a large dataset and evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shreyas202003/Image-Classifier.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Image_Classifier.ipynb` to train and test the model.
2. Make predictions on new images using the saved model `Image_classifier.h5`.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **X%** on the test set.
